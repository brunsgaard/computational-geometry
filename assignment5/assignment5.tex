$S$ is a set of disjoint polygons and $p_{start}$ is known. We wish to preprocess $S, p_{start}$ using $O(n^2 \log n)$ so we can find the shortest path from $p_{start}$ to any $p_{goal}$ in $O(n \log n)$. 

Let $S^{*} = S \cup p_{start}$. We can find the visibility graph $G_{vis}$ of $S^{*}$ in $O(n^2 \log n)$. We can compute the shortest path from $p_{start}$ to all vertices in $G_{vis}$ in $O(n \log n + O(n^2))$ using Dijkstra. For a point $p_{goal}$ we know from Lemma 15.1 that the vertices of the shortest path from $p_{start}$ to $p_{goal}$ are inner vertices of $S$. We can compute the vertices in $S$ that are visible from $p_{goal}$ in $O(n \log n)$, there are $O(n)$ visible vertices and we can find the shortest path by trying each of these $O(n)$ in constant time. 

Total preprocessing is $O(n^2 \log n) + O(n \log n + O(n^2)) = O(n^2 \log n)$. And total query time is $O(n \log n) + O(n) = O(n \log n)$.
